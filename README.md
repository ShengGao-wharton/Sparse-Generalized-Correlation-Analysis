## Overview

MATLAB Code and R Code Implementation for sparse GCA

For details of the algorithm, please check at https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00371.

## Algorithm

Sparse Generalized Correlation Analysis is based on thresholded gradient descent with generalized Fantope projection as initialization.

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in both MATLAB and R.
